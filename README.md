Hello Guys.!! ğŸ¤—  Actually this was a Diploma Final Year Project "Smart Plant Watering system With GSM" In this we are using SIM800 GSM  Module.  And coming to working of my project 1st it will test soil condition. After that it generate message as "System Is Just Now On" After that it will send messages to the user depending upon condition weather it contains moisture or not.  -->  If it gets wet condition then it will stop irrigation motor (  relay in program ) and sends Message to user as "WATER MOTOR OFF"   -->  if it gets dry condition then it will start irrigation motor ( realy in program ) and sends message to user as "WATER MOTOR ON"   -->  And you can change mobile number also to send message to user.  That's it Guys Enjoy ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
